   Non-contact vibration detection using vision technology offers advantages such as full-field synchronous measurement, minimal interference, and low cost, making it a promising technique. However, existing methods face challenges from environmental occlusions such as sunlight reflection and structural shadows, which impact the accuracy of vibration measurements in aerospace structures, high-altitude antennas, and similar equipment. The present study proposes a stereo vision vibration measurement method combined with dynamic modal parameters to effectively mitigate occlusion-induced interference, delivering high precision, simplicity, and robust performance in occluded environments. The study first analyzes and optimizes the algorithms for feature point extraction and matching. Sub-pixel precision localization is applied to improve feature point accuracy, and RANSAC is used during matching to eliminate erroneous matches, increasing matching accuracy. An experimental scheme for synchronous multi-point measurement of flexible component free vibration is presented. A self-built experimental platform is utilized for multiple rounds of testing to comprehensively evaluate the method's performance across various application scenarios. Results show that the method can control system errors within 0.1 mm/m. Without occlusion, the correlation coefficient between vision and laser measurements reaches 0.9983, and with occlusion, the correlation coefficient between vision and dynamic measurements remains as high as 0.9967. These results suggest that combining stereo vision vibration measurement with dynamic modal parameter analysis achieves notable accuracy and consistency, even with occlusions, indicating potential applicability for future developments.
